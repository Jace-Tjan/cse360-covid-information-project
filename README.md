# cse360-covid-information-project
This project was made by Jace Tjan, Delena Hoang, Samantha Turnage, and Manjot Bains for the course cse360 at ASU. It was to make a GUI which would take in information about covid from a .csv file and load, save, add in new information, and view the information using charts.
